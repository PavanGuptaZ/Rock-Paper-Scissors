## Overview


This project is a small web-based game that allows users to play the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game against the computer. Created with the intention of learning basic JavaScript concepts, I embarked on this project to gain hands-on experience in coding. The process involved understanding user input, implementing random computer choices, and applying basic game logic. The project served as a practical exercise to reinforce fundamental JavaScript skills, making the learning process engaging and enjoyable.

  

## Features

  

- User can choose between rock, paper, and scissors.

- Computer randomly selects one option after a Handshake animation.

- Score tracking for both the user and the computer.

- The game continues until one player reaches 3 points.
